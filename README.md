# EGGIT - Hatch the Habit of Learning Better

Welcome to **EGGIT**! This is a simple Flask web application designed to help users hatch the habit of learning better through personalized learning resources, scheduling, and user management. Built with **SQLite** as the database, this app includes basic user authentication and a clean interface for managing learning sessions.
